This is a project implementing cells from the thalamocortical network model of [Traub et al. 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?holding=modeldb&term=15525801) in NeuroML. 

Based on the NEURON implementation from: http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.asp?model=45539.

See http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/thalamocortical for more details.

A number of authors have contributed to the various implementations of this model in different simulators. See [here](AUTHORS.md) for details.

This project was contributed to by [Rokas Stanislovas](https://github.com/RokasSt) as part of the 
[2016 Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#53374629015715840). He worked on the conversion 
and testing of cell models to NeuroML2 and the creation of Python scripts to generate versions of the column. 
See [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/Thalamocortical/tree/master/NeuroML2) for more details.
